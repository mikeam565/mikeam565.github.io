## First Post!

My main motivation for this page is to have a little personal site out there.
I also realized that I want a place to document some of the coding I've been doing lately.
I intend to have Rust-related stuff here, as well as any other things I'm working on. I also 
intend to have some observations about the industry, insights, etc. available here as well.
This site was whipped up in a few hours of manual stream-of-consciousness html, css, and js, 
but markdown is really clean so I'm probably going to keep the blog in markdown.
