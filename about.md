# About

I am a graduate of New York Universityâ€™s class of 2022 with a joint degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently a Software Engineer at AT&T, working mainly in IVR (Interactive Voice Response) platform engineering (Java, Spring) and proof-of-concept ML application development (Python, Pandas, FastAPI, scikit).  

A few of my favorite hobbies include producing music, basketball, soccer, and cycling (road/gravel).
